name: uxmyths
description: Detects when a UX/product decision, critique, or piece of design advice rests on a common but false UX belief (e.g. "more choices = happier users", "icons alone are clear enough", "the homepage matters most", "users read the page"), and offers the evidence-based reality instead. Use this skill whenever an interface, user flow, redesign, feature scope, or design rationale is being discussed, justified, or written — whether in a product conversation, a mockup review, a spec, or while Claude Code writes or reviews front-end/UI code. Trigger even if the user doesn't say "myth" or "uxmyths" explicitly — stating a UX assumption as fact is enough.

# UX Myths

This skill gives Claude a checklist of 34 widespread but debunked UX beliefs, so it can catch when a design decision or piece of advice is quietly built on one of them — and offer the better-supported alternative instead.

## When to use it

- A design rationale leans on an unexamined UX "rule of thumb" ("keep menus under 7 items", "3-click rule", "users don't scroll", "icons are self-explanatory")
- Scoping or prioritizing features ("let's add more options, users will love it")
- Debating a redesign, a homepage revamp, or copying a competitor's pattern
- Deciding whether/how to test a design, or whether asking users what they want is enough
- Writing or reviewing front-end/UI code where a stated assumption drives a choice (icon-only buttons, hamburger menus, filler/lorem-ipsum content, cramming everything above the fold)
- Any UX audit or critique conversation, alongside `ux-laws` if that skill is also available

## How to apply it

**The goal is to correct gently and usefully, not to lecture with a numbered list.** Most conversations only touch one or two myths — surface those, not the whole catalogue.

- Name the myth only when it's actually driving the decision at hand — quote the specific belief being relied on, then give the debunking and the practical alternative in one or two sentences.
- Prefer evidence over assertion: mention the kind of finding that debunks it (usability testing results, eye-tracking data, analytics) without needing exact citations.
- If a stated "rule" turns out to be directionally reasonable in this specific context (e.g. genuinely fewer options really do serve this particular flow), say so — myths are about false universals, not about every instance of the underlying idea being wrong.
- For a full audit (user explicitly asks to review a design or spec against common misconceptions), walk the quick reference below and flag every myth that's plausibly in play.
- Stay concrete: tie the myth to the actual feature, page, or decision being discussed, not an abstract lecture on UX research.

## Quick reference

The 34 myths, one line each. For the full reasoning and evidence behind each one, see `references/myths.md`.

| # | Myth | Reality in one line |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | People read on the web | They scan for keywords and headings, and read word-for-word only once they've found what matters to them |
| 2 | All pages should be reachable in 3 clicks | Click count doesn't predict satisfaction — clear labeling does |
| 3 | People don't scroll | Scrolling is natural; most engagement happens below the fold |
| 4 | Design is about making it look good | Design is about how it works, not just how it looks |
| 5 | Accessibility is expensive and difficult | Designed in from the start, it costs about the same as inaccessible design |
| 6 | Accessible sites are ugly | Accessibility is about structure, not visual style — the two are independent |
| 7 | Graphics make an element more visible | Flashy graphics often trigger banner blindness and get ignored |
| 8 | Stock photos improve the experience | Purely decorative images are largely ignored or hurt credibility |
| 9 | Design has to be original | Familiar patterns need no learning curve — novelty adds friction |
| 10 | If the design is good, small details don't matter | Small wording/detail changes repeatedly move real conversion and satisfaction numbers |
| 11 | You need to redesign periodically | Users resent disruptive redesigns; incremental refinement wins long-term |
| 12 | More choices/features = more satisfaction | Simplicity drives post-use satisfaction more than feature count |
| 13 | Icons enhance usability | Most icons aren't self-explanatory — pair them with text labels |
| 14 | You are like your users | Building the product makes you atypical — validate with real users |
| 15 | Users make optimal choices | Users "satisfice": they take the first good-enough option, not the best one |
| 16 | Search solves navigation problems | Recognition beats recall — users click familiar links before they search |
| 17 | The homepage is your most important page | Its share of pageviews has fallen sharply as deep-linking grew |
| 18 | Flash was evil *(historical)* | Mature implementations could be accessible and SEO-friendly; mobile killed it, not usability alone |
| 19 | You don't need content to design a website | Designs built on filler text make unrealistic assumptions and often break with real content |
| 20 | If it works for Amazon, it will work for you | A pattern's success depends on context (traffic, trust, scale) that rarely transfers |
| 21 | People can tell you what they want | Stated preference often diverges sharply from actual behavior |
| 22 | Usability testing is expensive | Small, informal tests with ~5 users reliably surface most major issues |
| 23 | Choices should be limited to 7±2 | That's a short-term-memory limit, not a rule for on-screen, already-visible options |
| 24 | People use your product exactly as intended | Users routinely repurpose products — that's often a signal of real unmet needs |
| 25 | Aesthetics don't matter if usability is good | Visual appeal shapes perceived credibility and even perceived usability |
| 26 | Usability testing = focus groups | Focus groups capture opinions; usability tests observe actual behavior — different methods, different purposes |
| 27 | UX design is about usability | Usability is table stakes; UX also covers delight, emotion, and meaning |
| 28 | White space is wasted space | White space actively improves readability, hierarchy, and perceived quality |
| 29 | People are rational | Decisions are driven by predictable emotional shortcuts (anchoring, framing, loss aversion), not cold calculation |
| 30 | Experts don't need to test their designs | Expert review and user testing surface different problems — they complement, not replace, each other |
| 31 | UX design is one step in the project | User-centered design spans strategy through post-launch iteration, not just the wireframing step |
| 32 | Success happens overnight | Apparent overnight hits typically took years of iteration and false starts |
| 33 | Mobile users are distracted | Most mobile use happens at home/work, in the same context as desktop use |
| 34 | Simple means minimal | Visual minimalism can hide complexity; simplicity is about reduced effort, not reduced elements |

This skill is an original synthesis of the misconceptions catalogued by **Zoltán Gócza and Zoltán Kollin** on **[UX Myths](https://uxmyths.com)**. The myth list, numbering, and framing follow their site; the wording of each summary in `references/myths.md` and in this file was written independently for this skill, not copied from the source.
